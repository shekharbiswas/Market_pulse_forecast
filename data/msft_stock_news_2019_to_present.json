        "text": "BELLEVUE & REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Two major players, changing the gaming game. Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced a technical partnership to deliver the future of gaming in the U.S. with Project xCloud, beginning next month. The companies are working together to optimize the game streaming experience in the U.S. and learn more about the way gamers play games on mobile devices by streaming popular Xbox console titles over LTE. The deal combines Microsoft\u2019s expertise in cloud and gaming with the strength and reach of T-Mobile\u2019s LTE network today and vision for broad and deep 5G in the future. The public preview of Project xCloud will enable consumers to experience Xbox games streaming over LTE to a smartphone or tablet. \u201cMobile game streaming is the future and has the potential to unlock console-quality game play anywhere. I for one want to be at the forefront of that revolution driving it forward,\u201d said Neville Ray, Chief Technology Officer at T-Mobile. \u201cThat\u2019s why Microsoft chose T-Mobile and we answered \u2026 so T-Mobile customers can be some of the first to give this revolutionary service a try and to make sure our network is primed for the mobile game streaming future!\u201d Project xCloud is Microsoft\u2019s game streaming technology that empowers gamers to play console-quality games anywhere they are, on the mobile and tablet devices they already own. Microsoft\u2019s approach to game streaming combines nearly 40 years of gaming experience with resources and investments from across the company, including Azure\u2019s cloud footprint and an array of content from Xbox Game Studios. The technical partnership allows both companies to work together to better optimize the gaming experience for players in the U.S. Supported by T-Mobile\u2019s newest, most powerful LTE signal, 600 MHz, cloud gaming will let gamers experience console-quality games on their smartphones and tablets from virtually anywhere they want to play. No signal goes farther or is more reliable. \u201cWe chose T-Mobile as our technical partner for the Project xCloud preview in the US to leverage their mobile expertise as we embark on the next phase of our cloud gaming journey,\u201d said Kareem Choudhry, Corporate Vice President, Project xCloud. \u201cT-Mobile\u2019s strong network performance, excitement for gaming, and partnership will help us better understand how to meet the needs of gamers.\u201d Starting in October, Microsoft will invite a limited number of players into the Project xCloud public preview to stream popular Xbox titles over T-Mobile\u2019s advanced LTE network to their smartphones and tablets. Starting with Android, the preview will include Gears 5, Halo 5: Guardians, Sea of Thieves and Killer Instinct with more titles and devices coming over time. Microsoft will combine its expertise in gaming with the reach of T-Mobile\u2019s advanced nationwide LTE network and extensive experience in streaming services to leverage learnings from the U.S. Project xCloud preview and ensure they are delivering the best game streaming experience to customers. The Un-carrier envisions a future of gaming that\u2019s even more robust and immersive with broad and deep nationwide 5G from the New T-Mobile, if regulators approve the proposed merger with Sprint. While game streaming will work on today\u2019s LTE networks, broad and deep nationwide 5G opens the future possibility for an enhanced gaming experience with cutting-edge game streaming technology such as augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. T-Mobile delivers network performance that\u2019s neck-and-neck with competitors and now covers 326 million people with LTE \u2014 99% of Americans. That\u2019s all thanks to unprecedented investments in people and technology over the last three years, including adding one million square miles of new LTE coverage, adding more than 25,000 towers and cell sites, hiring more than 3,000 full time engineers and upgrading every single LTE cell site across the entirety of the network to deliver LTE-Advanced speeds and performance. To achieve these network enhancements, T-Mobile spent nearly $30 billion, with $7.99 billion dedicated to purchasing 600 MHz airwaves covering 100% of the U.S. \u2014 the company\u2019s largest investment ever. Gamers can sign up for a chance to participate in the Project xCloud public preview at http://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-streaming. T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers will need an unlimited data plan, a smartphone or tablet running Android 6.0 or higher with Bluetooth 4.0; a Microsoft account; and a Bluetooth-enabled Xbox One Wireless Controller. For more information about T-Mobile\u2019s network, visit www.t-mobile.com/coverage. On all T-Mobile plans, during congestion, the small fraction of customers using >50GB/mo. may notice reduced speeds until next bill cycle due to data prioritization. No signal is more reliable (traveling far and deep) than 600 MHz; capable device required, coverage not available in all areas.

David Turek will represent CATALOG and Don Doerner and Turguy Goker will represent Quantum. All three new board members bring to the Alliance extensive storage expertise and experience launching new technologies. \u201cSNIA welcomes the expansion of the DNA Data Storage Alliance board with the addition of Quantum and CATALOG. We are excited to see the Alliance expanding its membership and continuing to support the emergence of this important technology,\u201d said Dr. J Metz, Chair, SNIA Board of Directors. \u201cWith their talent and experience, David, Turguy, and Don will be excellent additions to the board. They\u2019ll help guide this nascent industry through the next phase, address the inevitable challenges, and eventually reach a broader consumer base for these innovative technologies.\u201d \u201cAt this pivotal moment in the evolution of DNA data storage, when the fundamentals of DNA synthesis and sequencing have progressed to the point where the storing of digital data in DNA molecules is technically feasible, it is vital to come together as an industry and implement standards that coalesce the whole sector in the drive to scale to commercially deployable systems,\u201d said David Turek, chief technology officer of CATALOG Technologies. \u201cI look forward to working with my fellow board members to help guide the Alliance toward this goal.\u201d \u201cBringing together diverse experience in storage media and technologies is critical to ensure that DNA data storage moves toward standardized interoperability and ultimately broad adoption by customers,\u201d said Turguy Goker, director of Advanced Development, Linear-Tape Open (LTO) at Quantum Corporation. \u201cSNIA and the DNA Data Storage Alliance are already making great strides to make this goal a reality.\u201d \u201cDNA data storage is primed to be a game-changer in data storage, providing the ability to efficiently store vast amounts of data for a long time,\u201d said Don Doerner, technical director, Office of the CTO at Quantum Corporation. \u201cAs an industry, we should embrace this potential, and I look forward to playing my part to help usher in this new era for the storage sector.\u201d David Turek joined CATALOG from IBM where he held numerous executive positions in high-performance computing and emerging technologies. Achievements include: acting as the development executive for the IBM SP program, which produced the first commercially successful, massively parallel system; starting IBM\u2019s Linux Cluster business; and launching an early offering in cloud computing called Deep Computing Capacity on Demand; producing the Roadrunner system, the world\u2019s first petascale computer; and managing IBM\u2019s exascale strategy, which led to the deployment of the Summit and Sierra systems at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories respectively. He has been invited to testify to Congress on numerous occasions regarding the future of computing in the United States and has helped establish technical collaborations with universities, businesses, and government agencies around the world. Turguy Goker represents Quantum with LTO organizations and leads the Advanced Development Team focused in LTO technology. He is a servo signal processing technology expert, with more than 30 years of experience in researching and designing tape drives, specifically LTO. Turguy has been one of the key contributors for researching low flying heads for HDD systems and was a key member of a small R&D team that was responsible for the original LTO project collaborating with HP Inc. and IBM, helping the formation of today\u2019s LTO organization and tape technology. Early in LTO, Turguy helped design and develop reel-to-reel motion control systems and the actuator tracking servo algorithms. Later in his career, he managed the LTO Advanced Development Team for Quantum. He has been responsible for developing next-generation data detection methods and electronic control concepts (ECC), including application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation and high-performance dual actuator-based adaptive servo control algorithms for multi-channel tape systems. Turguy holds a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from San Diego State University. Don Doerner joined Quantum in 2006 and is presently in the Office of the CTO, responsible for technology strategy, vision, and leadership of Quantum products. He is well-versed in storage and networking technology and has served in both engineering and product management roles at Quantum. His past projects include designing and implementing campus-area networks, automated tape storage libraries, error recovery algorithms for advanced tape storage devices and non-volatile memory express (NVMe)-based storage systems. He has led proofs-of-concept involving storage technology, such as object-based file systems, erasure coding and redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID). Don holds a master\u2019s degree in mathematics and a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics, both from the University of New Mexico. About the DNA Data Storage Alliance The DNA Data Storage Alliance was formed in October 2020 by Illumina, Microsoft, Twist Bioscience and Western Digital. Its mission is to create and promote an interoperable storage ecosystem based on manufactured DNA as a data storage medium. The Alliance is achieving its mission by: 1) educating the storage ecosystem and the public on this emerging technology; 2) identifying key technical challenges in the underlying technologies in order to drive funding and research which facilitate commercialization; and 3) developing standards and specifications (e.g., encoding, physical interfaces, retention, file systems) that enable the emergence of an interoperable DNA data storage product ecosystem. Please follow the DNA Data Storage Alliance on Twitter and LinkedIn. In 2022, the Alliance joined SNIA as a Technology Affiliate. SNIA\u2019s legacy as a standards-setting organization, combined with the Alliance\u2019s depth of knowledge in both storage and DNA technologies, provides a solid organizational foundation to achieve our goals.",

The agreement aims to minimize the potential impact of increased energy demand from data center construction on the state\u2019s residents. A key part of the deal requires the tech companies to contribute $1.5 million annually for five years to the Indiana Community Action Association. 11/25/2024 Over 5,300 people have reported problems with Microsoft 365 this morning, with 86% citing Outlook issues, 9% Exchange, and 6% SharePoint.

Analyst V. Sawalka now predicts earnings of $3.10 per share, down from the previous estimate of $3.19. 11/21/2024 Microsoft\u2019s stock price fell 1% today, trading as low as $410.29. 11/20/2024 Next month Michael Saylor, former MicroStrategy CEO, will pitch a Bitcoin adoption plan to Microsoft\u2019s board of directors.

A recent report revealed that Microsoft pledged $150 million in cybersecurity services to the federal government in 2021, including access to the premium Microsoft 365 Government G5 suite. While this move was initially seen as an effort to bolster U.S. cybersecurity, some critics argue that it could also have anti-competitive implications, locking the U.S. government into Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem, limiting competition, and potentially increasing costs. 11/15/2024 Microsoft is adopting a new format called CSAF as the company changes the way it shares information about security vulnerabilities. CSAF is easier for computers to read and will help organizations quickly identify and fix security problems. 11/14/2024 Microsoft is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for potential anti-competitive behavior in its cloud computing business. The FTC is concerned that Microsoft might be using its dominant position in productivity software to unfairly limit customers\u2019 choices, particularly with the company\u2019s cloud services making it difficult for customers to switch to other cloud providers. 11/12/2024 Despite a broader market downturn today, Microsoft rose 1.20% to $423.03. Microsoft\u2019s 10-Year Market Smashing Results Here\u2019s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018. Share Price Revenues Net Income 2014 $46.16 $86.83 $22.07 2015 $46.70 $93.58 $12.19 2016 $56.21 $91.15 $20.54 2017 $72.26 $96.57 $25.49 2018 $108.04 $110.36 $16.57 2019 $138.06 $125.84 $39.24 2020 $205.01 $143.02 $44.28 2021 $286.50 $168.09 $61.27 2022 $276.41 $198.27 $72.74 2023 $330.72 $211.92 $72.36 TTM $465.39 $279.99 $86.18 Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Microsoft\u2019s revenue grew 222% while its net income went from $22.07 billion to over $86 billion (in the trailing 12 months). A big driver of profits over the past decade was Microsoft\u2019s Intelligence cloud business, which grew 18% annually and drove operating profits of $37.88 billion in 2023 from $8.44 billion in 2014. As Microsoft looks to the second of the decade, a few key areas will determine its performance. Key Drivers of Microsoft\u2019s Stock Performance Productivity and Business Processes: Microsoft\u2019s Office and Dynamics 365 solutions and its LinkedIn products currently make up around one-third of the company\u2019s revenue. Office in particular holds a near monopoly in office productivity software and most 3rd party applications have embeds, making switching costs high for this business line. LinkedIn also does not have a solid competitor in the professional networking space. High growth rates in this segment, but Microsoft has the advantage of controlling its price on its high market share products. Intelligence Cloud: Microsoft\u2019s Azure, OpenAI, GitHub, and SQL, among other cloud businesses, make up close to half of the company\u2019s revenue. But the crown jewel is Azure which only makes up close to 30% of Microsoft\u2019s revenue and grew 30% over the past year alone. The future of Microsoft will depend on Azure and its competition with Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS will determine which company will dominate the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and reward shareholders handsomely in the process. Personal Computing: Windows, gaming, search, and devices are currently 25% of Microsoft\u2019s business and this segment is the most open to competitors eroding market share. Outside of Windows, which has a solidified market share (and is not likely to dwindle), Microsoft search and devices will be facing a steep uphill battle over the coming years. Its acquisition of Activision is a positive for its gaming line but personal computing will play an ancillary part in Microsoft\u2019s future. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Microsoft stock is $500.00, which is a 17.22% upside from today\u2019s stock price of $426.55. Of all the analysts covering Microsoft, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.39 \u201cBuy\u201d rating. 24/7 Wall Street\u2019s 12-month forecast projects Microsoft\u2019s stock price to be $495. We see Azure continuing its 20+% growth and earnings per share coming in right at $11.80. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue Net Income EPS 2024 $244.97 $88.93 $13.32 2025 $278.00 $99.25 $15.67 2026 $321.63 $115.65 $18.10 2027 $370.79 $136.81 $20.40 2028 $416.08 $151.87 $22.62 2029 $453.39 $166.56 $25.45 2030 $503.13 $181.71 $28.70 Revenue and net income in $billions Microsoft Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 How Microsoft\u2019s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect to see revenue growth just over 8% and EPS of $15.67 for 2025. We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Microsoft at $548.00 in 2025, which is 28.47% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $633.00, with small revenue gains but margins expanding and an EPS of $18.10. We expect to see Microsoft\u2019s P/E ratio steep down slowly each year through 2030. The stock price estimate would represent a 48.40% gain over today\u2019s share price of $426.55. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced and earnings estimates of $20.40 per share, the stock price target for the year is $652.00. That is a 3% year-over-year gain from the previous year, but still up 52.85% from today\u2019s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Microsoft\u2019s P/E ratio to drop to 30x in 2028 but grow its top line 14%. In 2028, we have Microsoft\u2019s revenue coming in around $420 billion and an EPS of $22.62 suggesting a stock price estimate at $678.00 or a gain of 58.95% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Microsoft to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings. With a price-to-earnings multiple of 35, the stock price in 2029 is estimated at $687.00, or a gain of 61.06% over today\u2019s price. Microsoft Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Microsoft\u2019s stock price to be $717.00 per share with a sub-10% year-over-year revenue growth. Our estimated stock price will be 68.09% higher than the current stock price of 426.55. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $495.00 Upside of 16.05% 2025 $548.00 Upside of 28.47% 2026 $633.00 Upside of 48.40% 2027 $652.00 Upside of 52.85% 2028 $678.00 Upside of 58.95% 2029 $687.00 Upside of 61.06% 2030 $717.00 Upside of 68.09% Want to Retire Early?

        "text": "The artificial intelligence-fueled rally has been the foremost contributor to the major market indices\u2019 sizable gains over the past several years. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs).ca As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Since the first day the market opened in 2023, shares have gained 837.17%, and in the decade from August 2014 to present, they are up a preposterous 29031.91%. In June 2024, NVIDIA underwent its sixth stock split, further fueling demand for its shares as the company surged upward and is now the second largest by market cap. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect enormous upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA\u2019s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA\u2019s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA\u2019s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb. If you\u2019re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\u201d report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA News and Updates 11/27/2024 Nvidia is reportedly prioritizing Samsung\u2019s GDDR7 memory for its upcoming GeForce RTX 50 series of graphics cards for desktops and AI notebooks. 11/26/2024 Nvidia has been working with a team of global researchers on a groundbreaking AI model, Fugatto (short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1). This versatile tool can generate or transform audio in countless ways: it can create music from simple text prompts, alter a singer\u2019s emotion or accent, and add or remove instruments from existing songs. 11/25/2024 Nvidia\u2019s stock declined by nearly 4% today, reaching a three-week low. 11/22/2024 PhillipCapital has downgraded Nvidia from \u201cBuy\u201d to \u201cAccumulate\u201d due to recent price swings as the company\u2019s Blackwell processors prepare for production. Despite the downgrade, however, PhillipCapital raised the target price for Nvidia from $155 to $160. 11/21/2024 Nvidia reported impressive third-quarter earnings, surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations. The company\u2019s strong performance was largely driven by the robust sales of its high-powered AI chips. Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion, outperforming the projected EPS of $0.74 and revenue of $33.2 billion. 11/20/2024 Nvidia\u2019s shares dipped by 2% today ahead of the company\u2019s much-anticipated earnings report. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, attributed the market\u2019s jitters to concerns over Nvidia\u2019s earnings and geopolitical tensions. 11/19/2024 Investors are closely watching Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings report, set to release tomorrow following the bell. Recent reports of overheating issues with the company\u2019s new Blackwell GPUs have raised concerns about potential delays and design changes. Investors will be looking for insights and the company\u2019s overall outlook during the earnings call. 11/18/2024 When installed in high-capacity server racks, Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell data center processors overheat. This has led to the need to redesign the server racks, which in turn could potentially delay shipping for the processors. If the redesign and shipping of the processors do not occur on time, Nvidia\u2019s major customers (Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc.) will be forced to delay their own timelines. 11/15/2024 As Nvidia prepares to release its earnings report next week, several top analysts have increased their price targets for the company. HSBC\u2019s Frank Lee has been the most optimistic, raising his target to $200, implying a potential 36.78% upside. Susquehanna\u2019s Christopher Rolland and Oppenheimer\u2019s Rich Schafer also increased their targets to $180 and $175, respectively. In contrast, Raymond James\u2019 Srini Pajjuri lowered his target to $170, although he still views any potential dip in Nvidia\u2019s stock price as a buying opportunity. 11/14/2024 Nvidia is scheduled to report its third-quarter financial results a week from today. Analysts predict a rise of 82% year-over-year in sales to $33.04 billion and an earnings increase to 75 cents a share. The Susquehanna Financial Group raised its price target for Nvidia from 160 to 180. NVIDIA\u2019s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA\u2019s share price since 2022. But before 2022\u2019s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA\u2019s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA\u2019s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies\u2019 market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $222.77 billion and $813.90 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA\u2019s $3.42 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company\u2019s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies \u2014 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) \u2014 account for 40% of NVIDIA\u2019s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with \u201ccontinuous research and innovation directed by tech giants [that] are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,\u201d according to Grand View Research\u2019s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $150.00, which represents a nearly 9.55% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $136.92. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on a scale from 1 (\u2018Strong Buy\u2019) to 5 (\u2018Strong Sell\u2019). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street\u2018s forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share. NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2025 $121.255 $68.392 $2.75 2026 $168.151 $95.246 $3.83 2027 $193.852 $108.182 $4.44 2028 $225.462 $130.155 $5.28 2029 $236.498 $152.001 $6.16 2030 $265.522 $175.412 $7.24 *Revenue and net income in $billions How NVIDIA\u2019s Next Five Years Could Play Out At the end of 2025, we expect to see revenue, net income and EPS rise 99%, 111.66% and 111.54%, respectively. That would result in a share price of $137.50, or 0.42% higher than where the stock is currently trading. Our high-end price target is $192.50, while our low-end price target is $82.50. When 2026 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA\u2019s revenue to be $168.151 billion resulting in a net income of $95.246 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $191.50, representing a gain of 39.86% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $268.10, while our low-end price target is $114.90. When 2027 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA\u2019s revenue to be $193.85 billion resulting in a net income of $108.182 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $222.00, representing a gain of 62.14% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $310.80, while our low-end price target is $133.20. When 2028 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA\u2019s revenue to be $225.462 billion resulting in a net income of $130.155 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $264.00, representing a gain of 92.81% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $369.60, while our low-end price target is $158.40. When 2029 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA\u2019s revenue to be $236.498 billion resulting in a net income of $152.001 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $308.00, representing a gain of 124.95% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $431.20, while our low-end price target is $184.40. NVIDIA Stocks Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that NVIDIA\u2019s stock will be trading for $362.00, good for a 164.39% increase over today\u2019s share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70. Meanwhile, our low-end price target is $217.20 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 30.

        "text": "According to PC Gamer, \u201cThe AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It\u2019s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it\u2019s also capable of outperforming Intel\u2019s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It\u2019s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.\u201d Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD\u2019s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel\u2019s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly \u2013 cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tens of billions to AMD\u2019s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD\u2019s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD\u2019s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su\u2019s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for \u201creunification\u201d with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD\u2019s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia\u2019s H100, industry publication Tom\u2019s Hardware estimates that AMD\u2019s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia\u2019s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn\u2019t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia\u2019s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup \u2014 putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it\u2019s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD\u2019s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers\u2019 own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su\u2019s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su\u2019s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD\u2019s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD\u2019s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 12/20/2024 Morgan Stanley analysts have lowered their price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $169 to $158, while maintaining an \u201cequal weight\u201d rating on the stock. Despite this lowered target, it still suggest a potential upside of 30.75% from AMD\u2019s current price. 12/18/2024 Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 stock has reached a 52-week low of $121.82, valuing the company at $199 billion. This decline, coupled with a beta of 1.64, indicates significant price volatility as investors grapple with economic uncertainties and shifting market dynamics. 12/16/2024 Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 stock price dipped 1.3% in midday trading today, reaching a low of $123.12. Trading volume was also much lower than average, with only 15.7 million shares changing hands. 12/12/2024 Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 stock experienced a slight decline of 0.2% during today\u2019s midday trading, fluctuating between $129.13 and $129.92. Trading volume was also much lower than average. 12/11/2024 Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 CEO Lisa Su has been named Time Magazine\u2019s CEO of the year. Since taking over in 2014, Su has orchestrated an incredible turnaround for the company, driving AMD\u2019s stock price up by a staggering 3700%. 12/9/2024 Vivek Arya, an analyst with Bank of America, downgraded Advanced Micro Devices stock from \u201cBuy\u201d to \u201cNeutral\u201d and lowered its price target from $180 to $155. This downgrade follows Amazon\u2019s executives reports of weak demand for AMD\u2019s AI accelerators and led to a decline in AMD\u2019s stock today. 12/6/2024 AMD\u2019s stock price has gone down today. This decrease followed an Amazon executive\u2019s report that the company hasn\u2019t observed enough demand for AMD\u2019s AI accelerators to warrant their sale through Amazon Web Services. 12/5/2024 Mizuho has lowered its price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $185 to $180, but still maintains a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock. This revised target price suggests a potential upside of 26.64% from AMD\u2019s current market price. 12/3/2024 Advanced Micro Devices stock declined 0.3% today, trading between $141.23 and $141.61. 11/27/2024 Advanced Micro Devices has solidified its commitment to Indian by inaugurating a new research and development center. This move aligns with the company\u2019s previously announced $400 million investment in the country. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD\u2019s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD\u2019s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD\u2019s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe\u2019s largest private AI Lab, in 2024. Fiscal Year (Dec) Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $2.87 $3.991 B -($660 M) 2016 $11.34 $4.319 B -($498 M) 2017 $10.28 $5.253 B -($33 M) 2018 $18.46 $6.475 B $337 M 2019 $45.86 $6.731 B $341 M 2020 $91.71 $9.763 B $2.490 B 2021 $143.90 $16.434 B $3.162 B 2022 $64.77 $23.601 B $1.320 B 2023 $147.41 $22.680 B $864 M 2024 LTM (Jun 2024) $$162.21 $23.276 B $$1.354 B Key Drivers for AMD\u2019s Stock in the Future Lisa Su\u2019s release of AMD\u2019s MI300 GPU has thrown down the gauntlet for AI to her cousin, CEO Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which controls close to 70% of the AI GPU market at present. AMD\u2019s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su\u2019s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT\u2019s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is \u201cbuy/outperform\u201d (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 47.99% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street\u2019s 12-month projection for AMD\u2019s price is $205.20, which would be a 62.48% increase. We believe Dr. Su\u2019s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD\u2019s Next 5 Years\u2019 Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD\u2019s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su\u2019s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD\u2019s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems\u2019 software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD\u2019s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD\u2019s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year\u2019s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD\u2019s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su\u2019s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20. Year EPS P/E multiple Price 2025 $6.84 30 $205.20 2026 $7.90 30 $237.12 2027 $9.81 30 $294.40 2028 $10.20 30 $306.00 2029 $11.20 30 $336.00 2030 $13.21 30 $396.20 Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored) Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.

        "text": "Ashton Kutcher first got into the spotlight as a famous actor, but he\u2019s now become a successful investor. Kutcher has been investing since 2009 and made early investments in Skype and Airbnb. He co-founded A-Grade Investments, which invests in startups long before their IPOs. He even has stakes in OpenAI, Anthropic, and Stability AI. He also offers great advice for investors, including this brilliant metaphor. He said, \u201c[investing] is like planting seeds; nurture them, and they will grow into something remarkable.\u201d Here\u2019s what this great insight means for investors. Key Points Ashton Kutcher shares valuable advice that emphasizes long-term investing. Time in the stock market often beats timing the market, and you\u2019ll save a lot of time too. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset\u2019s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don\u2019t waste another minute; get started by clicking here here.(Sponsor) Don\u2019t Try to Time the Stock Market Timing the stock market is one of the worst ways to approach investing. It\u2019s hard to time price fluctuations to find meaningful entry and exit points for long-term profits. Furthermore, it takes a lot of time to attempt to time the stock market. You can spend hours looking at charts and end up losing money at the same time. Instead of timing the stock market, you should focus on spending more time in the stock market. Kutcher\u2019s investments in Skype and Airbnb were great with foresight, but he had to endure the volatility of these startups before realizing his bigreturns. However, Skype and Airbnb are major success stories, not all investments pan out. However, timing the stock market can cause you to exit investments that continue to soar in the long run. Only Buy Companies That You Want to Hold for Five Years Waiting for investment seeds to grow into something spectacular requires long-term investing. Seeds don\u2019t grow into trees after a few weeks. It takes multiple years for the power of compounding to generate meaningful long-term gains. While market volatility can cause some investors to panic, it\u2019s easier to stay the course if you buy companies that you believe in. Investors should only initiate positions in growth stocks that they feel confident about holding for the next five years. Using this parameter can help investors avoid flashy stocks that capture headlines today and collapse after a few years. Buying companies with this mentality can also help you sleep better at night when the stock market closes. Give Yourself Long-Term Investing Goals You can\u2019t set long-term goals around your long-term returns since that can lead to riskier investments. However, you can set goals around how much you contribute to your portfolio each month. Boosting your portfolio contributions is one of the best ways to grow your portfolio. This sounds obvious, but some people are more focused on finding an investment that might gain 100% than looking for ways to increase their portfolio contribution by 10% each year. Putting more money into the stock market allows investors to make less risky investments to achieve their financial goals. It also goes back to Kutcher\u2019s saying about how a seed can turn into something remarkable. It\u2019s great to plant one seed, but what if you could plant numerous seeds that turn into remarkable things? Investing more money makes that possible, and you can only increase your portfolio contributions by increasing your income or minimizing your expenses. It doesn\u2019t take much time to reduce costs before you can\u2019t reduce them anymore, so it\u2019s good to prioritize income growth after you establish a budget.

## Conclusion - feature selections

By combining **sentiment analysis**, **stock price data**, **technical indicators**, we can create a robust model that captures complex relationships and patterns in stock price movements.


## 🧼 Handling Missing Values

In real-world financial and news datasets, missing values are common due to:
- Rolling technical indicators (e.g., moving averages, RSI)
- Gaps in sentiment coverage (no news on certain days)
- Lagging computations (e.g., MACD, Bollinger bands)

To avoid losing valuable time series data, we do **not drop rows**. Instead, we apply a feature-aware missing value strategy:

### 🛠 Strategy

| Feature Type            | Imputation Strategy        | Rationale                                  |
|-------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Price/Volume            | Forward + Backward Fill    | Price trends are continuous in time        |
| Technical Indicators    | Forward + Backward Fill    | Lagging features can be interpolated       |
| Sentiment Scores        | Fill with `0`              | Missing sentiment implies neutral impact   |
| News Volume/Impact      | Fill with `0`              | No news = no influence                     |
| Calendar Features       | Always present             | Extracted directly from date               |

### 🧪 Example Implementation

```python
# Forward fill & backfill all numeric values
df = df.ffill().bfill()

# Neutral fill for sentiment-related features
for col in ['sentiment_score', 'average_sentiment_last_24h',
            'news_volatility_impact', 'news_count_last_24h']:
    if col in df.columns:
        df[col] = df[col].fillna(0)
```


✅ Result
- All rows are preserved
- No data leakage from future timestamps
- Model remains robust and interpretable

## 🧩 Module Descriptions

### `loader.py`
Loads the merged dataset containing historical stock prices and sentiment features.  
Also includes a basic preprocessing function to sort by date and remove rows without essential price data (e.g., missing close prices).

### `features.py`
Adds support for configurable feature selection and robust handling of missing values.  
Includes forward/backward filling for technical features and neutral value filling for sentiment data, ensuring no row is dropped.

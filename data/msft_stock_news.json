        "text": "BELLEVUE & REDMOND, Wash.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Two major players, changing the gaming game. Today, T-Mobile (NASDAQ: TMUS) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) announced a technical partnership to deliver the future of gaming in the U.S. with Project xCloud, beginning next month. The companies are working together to optimize the game streaming experience in the U.S. and learn more about the way gamers play games on mobile devices by streaming popular Xbox console titles over LTE. The deal combines Microsoft\u2019s expertise in cloud and gaming with the strength and reach of T-Mobile\u2019s LTE network today and vision for broad and deep 5G in the future. The public preview of Project xCloud will enable consumers to experience Xbox games streaming over LTE to a smartphone or tablet. \u201cMobile game streaming is the future and has the potential to unlock console-quality game play anywhere. I for one want to be at the forefront of that revolution driving it forward,\u201d said Neville Ray, Chief Technology Officer at T-Mobile. \u201cThat\u2019s why Microsoft chose T-Mobile and we answered \u2026 so T-Mobile customers can be some of the first to give this revolutionary service a try and to make sure our network is primed for the mobile game streaming future!\u201d Project xCloud is Microsoft\u2019s game streaming technology that empowers gamers to play console-quality games anywhere they are, on the mobile and tablet devices they already own. Microsoft\u2019s approach to game streaming combines nearly 40 years of gaming experience with resources and investments from across the company, including Azure\u2019s cloud footprint and an array of content from Xbox Game Studios. The technical partnership allows both companies to work together to better optimize the gaming experience for players in the U.S. Supported by T-Mobile\u2019s newest, most powerful LTE signal, 600 MHz, cloud gaming will let gamers experience console-quality games on their smartphones and tablets from virtually anywhere they want to play. No signal goes farther or is more reliable. \u201cWe chose T-Mobile as our technical partner for the Project xCloud preview in the US to leverage their mobile expertise as we embark on the next phase of our cloud gaming journey,\u201d said Kareem Choudhry, Corporate Vice President, Project xCloud. \u201cT-Mobile\u2019s strong network performance, excitement for gaming, and partnership will help us better understand how to meet the needs of gamers.\u201d Starting in October, Microsoft will invite a limited number of players into the Project xCloud public preview to stream popular Xbox titles over T-Mobile\u2019s advanced LTE network to their smartphones and tablets. Starting with Android, the preview will include Gears 5, Halo 5: Guardians, Sea of Thieves and Killer Instinct with more titles and devices coming over time. Microsoft will combine its expertise in gaming with the reach of T-Mobile\u2019s advanced nationwide LTE network and extensive experience in streaming services to leverage learnings from the U.S. Project xCloud preview and ensure they are delivering the best game streaming experience to customers. The Un-carrier envisions a future of gaming that\u2019s even more robust and immersive with broad and deep nationwide 5G from the New T-Mobile, if regulators approve the proposed merger with Sprint. While game streaming will work on today\u2019s LTE networks, broad and deep nationwide 5G opens the future possibility for an enhanced gaming experience with cutting-edge game streaming technology such as augmented reality, virtual reality and artificial intelligence. T-Mobile delivers network performance that\u2019s neck-and-neck with competitors and now covers 326 million people with LTE \u2014 99% of Americans. That\u2019s all thanks to unprecedented investments in people and technology over the last three years, including adding one million square miles of new LTE coverage, adding more than 25,000 towers and cell sites, hiring more than 3,000 full time engineers and upgrading every single LTE cell site across the entirety of the network to deliver LTE-Advanced speeds and performance. To achieve these network enhancements, T-Mobile spent nearly $30 billion, with $7.99 billion dedicated to purchasing 600 MHz airwaves covering 100% of the U.S. \u2014 the company\u2019s largest investment ever. Gamers can sign up for a chance to participate in the Project xCloud public preview at http://www.xbox.com/xbox-game-streaming. T-Mobile and Metro by T-Mobile customers will need an unlimited data plan, a smartphone or tablet running Android 6.0 or higher with Bluetooth 4.0; a Microsoft account; and a Bluetooth-enabled Xbox One Wireless Controller. For more information about T-Mobile\u2019s network, visit www.t-mobile.com/coverage. On all T-Mobile plans, during congestion, the small fraction of customers using >50GB/mo. may notice reduced speeds until next bill cycle due to data prioritization. No signal is more reliable (traveling far and deep) than 600 MHz; capable device required, coverage not available in all areas.

David Turek will represent CATALOG and Don Doerner and Turguy Goker will represent Quantum. All three new board members bring to the Alliance extensive storage expertise and experience launching new technologies. \u201cSNIA welcomes the expansion of the DNA Data Storage Alliance board with the addition of Quantum and CATALOG. We are excited to see the Alliance expanding its membership and continuing to support the emergence of this important technology,\u201d said Dr. J Metz, Chair, SNIA Board of Directors. \u201cWith their talent and experience, David, Turguy, and Don will be excellent additions to the board. They\u2019ll help guide this nascent industry through the next phase, address the inevitable challenges, and eventually reach a broader consumer base for these innovative technologies.\u201d \u201cAt this pivotal moment in the evolution of DNA data storage, when the fundamentals of DNA synthesis and sequencing have progressed to the point where the storing of digital data in DNA molecules is technically feasible, it is vital to come together as an industry and implement standards that coalesce the whole sector in the drive to scale to commercially deployable systems,\u201d said David Turek, chief technology officer of CATALOG Technologies. \u201cI look forward to working with my fellow board members to help guide the Alliance toward this goal.\u201d \u201cBringing together diverse experience in storage media and technologies is critical to ensure that DNA data storage moves toward standardized interoperability and ultimately broad adoption by customers,\u201d said Turguy Goker, director of Advanced Development, Linear-Tape Open (LTO) at Quantum Corporation. \u201cSNIA and the DNA Data Storage Alliance are already making great strides to make this goal a reality.\u201d \u201cDNA data storage is primed to be a game-changer in data storage, providing the ability to efficiently store vast amounts of data for a long time,\u201d said Don Doerner, technical director, Office of the CTO at Quantum Corporation. \u201cAs an industry, we should embrace this potential, and I look forward to playing my part to help usher in this new era for the storage sector.\u201d David Turek joined CATALOG from IBM where he held numerous executive positions in high-performance computing and emerging technologies. Achievements include: acting as the development executive for the IBM SP program, which produced the first commercially successful, massively parallel system; starting IBM\u2019s Linux Cluster business; and launching an early offering in cloud computing called Deep Computing Capacity on Demand; producing the Roadrunner system, the world\u2019s first petascale computer; and managing IBM\u2019s exascale strategy, which led to the deployment of the Summit and Sierra systems at Oak Ridge and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratories respectively. He has been invited to testify to Congress on numerous occasions regarding the future of computing in the United States and has helped establish technical collaborations with universities, businesses, and government agencies around the world. Turguy Goker represents Quantum with LTO organizations and leads the Advanced Development Team focused in LTO technology. He is a servo signal processing technology expert, with more than 30 years of experience in researching and designing tape drives, specifically LTO. Turguy has been one of the key contributors for researching low flying heads for HDD systems and was a key member of a small R&D team that was responsible for the original LTO project collaborating with HP Inc. and IBM, helping the formation of today\u2019s LTO organization and tape technology. Early in LTO, Turguy helped design and develop reel-to-reel motion control systems and the actuator tracking servo algorithms. Later in his career, he managed the LTO Advanced Development Team for Quantum. He has been responsible for developing next-generation data detection methods and electronic control concepts (ECC), including application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) implementation and high-performance dual actuator-based adaptive servo control algorithms for multi-channel tape systems. Turguy holds a master\u2019s degree in electrical engineering from San Diego State University. Don Doerner joined Quantum in 2006 and is presently in the Office of the CTO, responsible for technology strategy, vision, and leadership of Quantum products. He is well-versed in storage and networking technology and has served in both engineering and product management roles at Quantum. His past projects include designing and implementing campus-area networks, automated tape storage libraries, error recovery algorithms for advanced tape storage devices and non-volatile memory express (NVMe)-based storage systems. He has led proofs-of-concept involving storage technology, such as object-based file systems, erasure coding and redundant array of inexpensive disks (RAID). Don holds a master\u2019s degree in mathematics and a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics, both from the University of New Mexico. About the DNA Data Storage Alliance The DNA Data Storage Alliance was formed in October 2020 by Illumina, Microsoft, Twist Bioscience and Western Digital. Its mission is to create and promote an interoperable storage ecosystem based on manufactured DNA as a data storage medium. The Alliance is achieving its mission by: 1) educating the storage ecosystem and the public on this emerging technology; 2) identifying key technical challenges in the underlying technologies in order to drive funding and research which facilitate commercialization; and 3) developing standards and specifications (e.g., encoding, physical interfaces, retention, file systems) that enable the emergence of an interoperable DNA data storage product ecosystem. Please follow the DNA Data Storage Alliance on Twitter and LinkedIn. In 2022, the Alliance joined SNIA as a Technology Affiliate. SNIA\u2019s legacy as a standards-setting organization, combined with the Alliance\u2019s depth of knowledge in both storage and DNA technologies, provides a solid organizational foundation to achieve our goals.",

        "text": "Everyone knows Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and its best-known products, including the Windows operating system and Microsoft 365 suite of productivity apps, but its growing cloud computing platform, Azure, is the future of the company. Microsoft stock has been a millionaire maker for decades, with a stock split-adjusted IPO price of $0.14, which means at today\u2019s stock price of $426.55, the stock is up 438286.43%. That would have turned a $1000 investment at Microsoft\u2019s IPO into $4.38 million today. As one of the most valuable companies in the world, the only thing investors focus on is what the stock will do over the coming years. Wall Street analysts only go as far as 1 year out when giving a stock prediction. But long-term investors want to know where Microsoft might be several years down the road. 24/7 Wall Street aims to give you our assumptions on the stock and provide our insights around the numbers coming from Microsoft and which markets the company is operating in that are most exciting to us. Key Points in this Article: Key growth drivers: Azure cloud services, productivity software, and LinkedIn dominate Microsoft\u2019s future potential. Microsoft\u2019s acquisition of Activision boosts its gaming segment, enhancing its competitive edge in the personal computing market.

It has a software stock that could ride dominance in AI to returns of 10X or more. Recent Microsoft Stock Updates and News 11/27/2024 Microsoft has partnered with Coles Group (CLEGF), an Australian retail company. The five-year deal aims to further enhance Coles\u2019 cloud and AI capabilities. 11/26/2024 Indiana has secured an important deal with tech giants Microsoft, Amazon Web Services, and Google. The agreement aims to minimize the potential impact of increased energy demand from data center construction on the state\u2019s residents. A key part of the deal requires the tech companies to contribute $1.5 million annually for five years to the Indiana Community Action Association. 11/25/2024 Over 5,300 people have reported problems with Microsoft 365 this morning, with 86% citing Outlook issues, 9% Exchange, and 6% SharePoint. Microsoft initiated a fix around 9 AM EST, and reports that 98% of users have regained access. 11/22/2024 Microsoft\u2019s earnings outlook for the second quarter of 2025 has been lowered by Zacks Research. Analyst V. Sawalka now predicts earnings of $3.10 per share, down from the previous estimate of $3.19. 11/21/2024 Microsoft\u2019s stock price fell 1% today, trading as low as $410.29. 11/20/2024 Next month Michael Saylor, former MicroStrategy CEO, will pitch a Bitcoin adoption plan to Microsoft\u2019s board of directors. Saylor believes Bitcoin could be a game-changer for Microsoft, potentially generating the company\u2019s next trillion dollars. 11/19/2024 Microsoft announced a new application server at its 2024 Ignite conference today: the Azure AI Foundry, which aims to streamline AI development. Microsoft plans to do this by consolidating Microsoft\u2019s diverse AI models, tools, safety measures, and monitoring capabilities into a single, integrated platform. 11/18/2024 Microsoft has come under scrutiny for its business practices with the U.S. government. A recent report revealed that Microsoft pledged $150 million in cybersecurity services to the federal government in 2021, including access to the premium Microsoft 365 Government G5 suite. While this move was initially seen as an effort to bolster U.S. cybersecurity, some critics argue that it could also have anti-competitive implications, locking the U.S. government into Microsoft\u2019s ecosystem, limiting competition, and potentially increasing costs. 11/15/2024 Microsoft is adopting a new format called CSAF as the company changes the way it shares information about security vulnerabilities. CSAF is easier for computers to read and will help organizations quickly identify and fix security problems. 11/14/2024 Microsoft is under investigation by the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for potential anti-competitive behavior in its cloud computing business. The FTC is concerned that Microsoft might be using its dominant position in productivity software to unfairly limit customers\u2019 choices, particularly with the company\u2019s cloud services making it difficult for customers to switch to other cloud providers. 11/12/2024 Despite a broader market downturn today, Microsoft rose 1.20% to $423.03. Microsoft\u2019s 10-Year Market Smashing Results Here\u2019s a table summarizing performance in share price, revenues, and profits (net income) from 2014 to 2018. Share Price Revenues Net Income 2014 $46.16 $86.83 $22.07 2015 $46.70 $93.58 $12.19 2016 $56.21 $91.15 $20.54 2017 $72.26 $96.57 $25.49 2018 $108.04 $110.36 $16.57 2019 $138.06 $125.84 $39.24 2020 $205.01 $143.02 $44.28 2021 $286.50 $168.09 $61.27 2022 $276.41 $198.27 $72.74 2023 $330.72 $211.92 $72.36 TTM $465.39 $279.99 $86.18 Revenue and net income in $billions In the last decade, Microsoft\u2019s revenue grew 222% while its net income went from $22.07 billion to over $86 billion (in the trailing 12 months). A big driver of profits over the past decade was Microsoft\u2019s Intelligence cloud business, which grew 18% annually and drove operating profits of $37.88 billion in 2023 from $8.44 billion in 2014. As Microsoft looks to the second of the decade, a few key areas will determine its performance. Key Drivers of Microsoft\u2019s Stock Performance Productivity and Business Processes: Microsoft\u2019s Office and Dynamics 365 solutions and its LinkedIn products currently make up around one-third of the company\u2019s revenue. Office in particular holds a near monopoly in office productivity software and most 3rd party applications have embeds, making switching costs high for this business line. LinkedIn also does not have a solid competitor in the professional networking space. High growth rates in this segment, but Microsoft has the advantage of controlling its price on its high market share products. Intelligence Cloud: Microsoft\u2019s Azure, OpenAI, GitHub, and SQL, among other cloud businesses, make up close to half of the company\u2019s revenue. But the crown jewel is Azure which only makes up close to 30% of Microsoft\u2019s revenue and grew 30% over the past year alone. The future of Microsoft will depend on Azure and its competition with Amazon\u2019s (NASDAQ: AMZN) AWS will determine which company will dominate the Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) and reward shareholders handsomely in the process. Personal Computing: Windows, gaming, search, and devices are currently 25% of Microsoft\u2019s business and this segment is the most open to competitors eroding market share. Outside of Windows, which has a solidified market share (and is not likely to dwindle), Microsoft search and devices will be facing a steep uphill battle over the coming years. Its acquisition of Activision is a positive for its gaming line but personal computing will play an ancillary part in Microsoft\u2019s future. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus 1-year price target for Microsoft stock is $500.00, which is a 17.22% upside from today\u2019s stock price of $426.55. Of all the analysts covering Microsoft, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.39 \u201cBuy\u201d rating. 24/7 Wall Street\u2019s 12-month forecast projects Microsoft\u2019s stock price to be $495. We see Azure continuing its 20+% growth and earnings per share coming in right at $11.80. Microsoft (MSFT) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue Net Income EPS 2024 $244.97 $88.93 $13.32 2025 $278.00 $99.25 $15.67 2026 $321.63 $115.65 $18.10 2027 $370.79 $136.81 $20.40 2028 $416.08 $151.87 $22.62 2029 $453.39 $166.56 $25.45 2030 $503.13 $181.71 $28.70 Revenue and net income in $billions Microsoft Share Price Estimates 2025-2030 How Microsoft\u2019s Next 5 Years Could Play Out We expect to see revenue growth just over 8% and EPS of $15.67 for 2025. We expect the stock to still trade at a similar multiple next year, putting our estimate for the stock price for Microsoft at $548.00 in 2025, which is 28.47% higher than the stock is trading today. Going into 2026, we estimate the price to be $633.00, with small revenue gains but margins expanding and an EPS of $18.10. We expect to see Microsoft\u2019s P/E ratio steep down slowly each year through 2030. The stock price estimate would represent a 48.40% gain over today\u2019s share price of $426.55. Heading into 2027, we expect the stock price increase not to be as pronounced and earnings estimates of $20.40 per share, the stock price target for the year is $652.00. That is a 3% year-over-year gain from the previous year, but still up 52.85% from today\u2019s stock price. When predicting more than 3 years out, we expect Microsoft\u2019s P/E ratio to drop to 30x in 2028 but grow its top line 14%. In 2028, we have Microsoft\u2019s revenue coming in around $420 billion and an EPS of $22.62 suggesting a stock price estimate at $678.00 or a gain of 58.95% over the current stock price. 24/7 Wall Street expects Microsoft to continue its 10% revenue growth again and to generate $12.30 per share of earnings. With a price-to-earnings multiple of 35, the stock price in 2029 is estimated at $687.00, or a gain of 61.06% over today\u2019s price. Microsoft Stocks Price Target for 2030 We estimate Microsoft\u2019s stock price to be $717.00 per share with a sub-10% year-over-year revenue growth. Our estimated stock price will be 68.09% higher than the current stock price of 426.55. Year Price Target % Change From Current Price 2024 $495.00 Upside of 16.05% 2025 $548.00 Upside of 28.47% 2026 $633.00 Upside of 48.40% 2027 $652.00 Upside of 52.85% 2028 $678.00 Upside of 58.95% 2029 $687.00 Upside of 61.06% 2030 $717.00 Upside of 68.09% Want to Retire Early?

        "text": "The artificial intelligence-fueled rally has been the foremost contributor to the major market indices\u2019 sizable gains over the past several years. And one company in particular is at the vanguard: NVIDIA Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA). NVIDIA is the premier manufacturer of components critical to the surge in AI; namely, semiconductors, microchips, and graphics processing units (GPUs).ca As a result, the Santa Clara, Calif.-based company has seen its stock skyrocket in the recent past. Since the first day the market opened in 2023, shares have gained 837.17%, and in the decade from August 2014 to present, they are up a preposterous 29031.91%. In June 2024, NVIDIA underwent its sixth stock split, further fueling demand for its shares as the company surged upward and is now the second largest by market cap. Despite those mind-boggling gains, analysts still expect enormous upside potential in the medium and long term. 24/7 Wall Street has performed analysis to provide prospective investors and current shareholders with an idea of where NVIDIA\u2019s stock might be headed over the course of the next five years. Key Points in This Article: NVIDIA\u2019s track record of strong earnings suggests an ability to remain at the forefront of its industry, as competitors fight for the leftovers. Between NVIDIA\u2019s client list of Magnificent Seven companies and the burgeoning trend in AI, growth in both revenue and net income is projected to continue its steep climb. If you\u2019re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\u201d report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. NVIDIA News and Updates 11/27/2024 Nvidia is reportedly prioritizing Samsung\u2019s GDDR7 memory for its upcoming GeForce RTX 50 series of graphics cards for desktops and AI notebooks. 11/26/2024 Nvidia has been working with a team of global researchers on a groundbreaking AI model, Fugatto (short for Foundational Generative Audio Transformer Opus 1). This versatile tool can generate or transform audio in countless ways: it can create music from simple text prompts, alter a singer\u2019s emotion or accent, and add or remove instruments from existing songs. 11/25/2024 Nvidia\u2019s stock declined by nearly 4% today, reaching a three-week low. 11/22/2024 PhillipCapital has downgraded Nvidia from \u201cBuy\u201d to \u201cAccumulate\u201d due to recent price swings as the company\u2019s Blackwell processors prepare for production. Despite the downgrade, however, PhillipCapital raised the target price for Nvidia from $155 to $160. 11/21/2024 Nvidia reported impressive third-quarter earnings, surpassing analysts\u2019 expectations. The company\u2019s strong performance was largely driven by the robust sales of its high-powered AI chips. Nvidia reported earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 on revenue of $35.1 billion, outperforming the projected EPS of $0.74 and revenue of $33.2 billion. 11/20/2024 Nvidia\u2019s shares dipped by 2% today ahead of the company\u2019s much-anticipated earnings report. Ryan Detrick, chief market strategist at Carson Group, attributed the market\u2019s jitters to concerns over Nvidia\u2019s earnings and geopolitical tensions. 11/19/2024 Investors are closely watching Nvidia\u2019s upcoming earnings report, set to release tomorrow following the bell. Recent reports of overheating issues with the company\u2019s new Blackwell GPUs have raised concerns about potential delays and design changes. Investors will be looking for insights and the company\u2019s overall outlook during the earnings call. 11/18/2024 When installed in high-capacity server racks, Nvidia\u2019s next-generation Blackwell data center processors overheat. This has led to the need to redesign the server racks, which in turn could potentially delay shipping for the processors. If the redesign and shipping of the processors do not occur on time, Nvidia\u2019s major customers (Google, Microsoft, Meta, etc.) will be forced to delay their own timelines. 11/15/2024 As Nvidia prepares to release its earnings report next week, several top analysts have increased their price targets for the company. HSBC\u2019s Frank Lee has been the most optimistic, raising his target to $200, implying a potential 36.78% upside. Susquehanna\u2019s Christopher Rolland and Oppenheimer\u2019s Rich Schafer also increased their targets to $180 and $175, respectively. In contrast, Raymond James\u2019 Srini Pajjuri lowered his target to $170, although he still views any potential dip in Nvidia\u2019s stock price as a buying opportunity. 11/14/2024 Nvidia is scheduled to report its third-quarter financial results a week from today. Analysts predict a rise of 82% year-over-year in sales to $33.04 billion and an earnings increase to 75 cents a share. The Susquehanna Financial Group raised its price target for Nvidia from 160 to 180. NVIDIA\u2019s Recent Stock Success Unless you have been living under a rock, chances are you have caught wind of the very well-documented and rather exponential surge in NVIDIA\u2019s share price since 2022. But before 2022\u2019s price-per-share explosion, it was steadily appreciating as it underwent a series of stock splits. Year Share Price* Revenue** Net Income** 2014 $0.51 $4.130 $0.588 2015 $0.82 $4.681 $0.800 2016 $2.67 $5.010 $0.929 2017 $4.88 $6.910 $1.851 2018 $3.24 $9.714 $3.085 2019 $5.98 $11.716 $4.143 2020 $13.06 $10.918 $3.580 2021 $29.64 $16.675 $6.277 2022 $14.61 $26.914 $11.259 2023 $49.52 $26.974 $8.366 *Post-split adjusted basis **Revenue and net income in $billions Over the course of the last decade, NVIDIA\u2019s revenue grew by more than 553% while its net income increased by just over 1,323%. The company experienced a slight contraction in revenue and net income in 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but it rebounded soundly the following year and has continued to steadily grow both metrics since. Meanwhile, shares were able to increase by 9,610% from 2014 to 2023. As the AI lynchpin looks forward to the second half of the decade, 24/7 Wall Street has identified three key drivers that are likely to impact its growth metrics and stock performance through 2030. Key Drivers of NVIDIA\u2019s Stock Performance Stronghold on the GPU Industry: No one makes GPUs like Nvidia makes GPUs, and the industry demanding them is well aware of that. While semiconductor competitors like Advanced Micro Devices Inc. (NASDAQ: AMD) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd. (NYSE: TSM) do command some attention in their respective corners of the market, simply comparing the three companies\u2019 market caps demonstrates the discrepancies between NVIDIA and, well, every other company. While Advanced Micro Devices and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing have respectable market caps of $222.77 billion and $813.90 billion, respectively, those are dwarfed by NVIDIA\u2019s $3.42 trillion. Demand From Unrivaled Tech Customers: The company\u2019s primary clientele are the other members of the Magnificent Seven, which are leading the way forward in the AI revolution. In fact, only four Big Tech rival companies \u2014 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ: MSFT) \u2014 account for 40% of NVIDIA\u2019s revenue as they vie with one another to become the front runner of the transition to generative AI. The AI Trend Is Just Getting Started: According to Grand View Research, the market size of AI in 2023 was $196.63 billion. As large as that seems, it pales in comparison to where the market is headed. From 2024 to 2030, it is expected that the industry will grow at an astounding compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 36.6%, with \u201ccontinuous research and innovation directed by tech giants [that] are driving adoption of advanced technologies in industry verticals, such as automotive, healthcare, retail, finance, and manufacturing,\u201d according to Grand View Research\u2019s report. NVIDIA (NVDA) Price Prediction in 2025 The current consensus median one-year price target for NVIDIA, according to analysts, is $150.00, which represents a nearly 9.55% potential upside over the next 12 months based on the current share price of $136.92. Of all the analysts covering NVIDIA, the stock is a consensus buy, with a 1.3 \u2018Buy\u2019 rating on a scale from 1 (\u2018Strong Buy\u2019) to 5 (\u2018Strong Sell\u2019). However, by the end of 2025, 24/7 Wall Street\u2018s forecast projects shares of NVIDIA to be trading for $137.50 based on a projected EPS of $2.75 and a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 50, with a best-case scenario of $192.50 per share and a worst-case scenario of $82.50 per share. NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock Forecast Through 2030 Year Revenue* Net Income* EPS 2025 $121.255 $68.392 $2.75 2026 $168.151 $95.246 $3.83 2027 $193.852 $108.182 $4.44 2028 $225.462 $130.155 $5.28 2029 $236.498 $152.001 $6.16 2030 $265.522 $175.412 $7.24 *Revenue and net income in $billions How NVIDIA\u2019s Next Five Years Could Play Out At the end of 2025, we expect to see revenue, net income and EPS rise 99%, 111.66% and 111.54%, respectively. That would result in a share price of $137.50, or 0.42% higher than where the stock is currently trading. Our high-end price target is $192.50, while our low-end price target is $82.50. When 2026 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA\u2019s revenue to be $168.151 billion resulting in a net income of $95.246 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $191.50, representing a gain of 39.86% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $268.10, while our low-end price target is $114.90. When 2027 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA\u2019s revenue to be $193.85 billion resulting in a net income of $108.182 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $222.00, representing a gain of 62.14% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $310.80, while our low-end price target is $133.20. When 2028 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA\u2019s revenue to be $225.462 billion resulting in a net income of $130.155 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $264.00, representing a gain of 92.81% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $369.60, while our low-end price target is $158.40. When 2029 concludes, we forecast NVIDIA\u2019s revenue to be $236.498 billion resulting in a net income of $152.001 billion. That year would end with a per-share price of $308.00, representing a gain of 124.95% compared to its share price today. Our high-end price target is $431.20, while our low-end price target is $184.40. NVIDIA Stocks Price Target for 2030 By the conclusion of 2030, 24/7 Wall Street estimates that NVIDIA\u2019s stock will be trading for $362.00, good for a 164.39% increase over today\u2019s share price, based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 50. Our high-end price target is $506.80 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 70. Meanwhile, our low-end price target is $217.20 based on an EPS of $7.24 and a P/E ratio of 30.

        "text": "According to PC Gamer, \u201cThe AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D is simply the best gaming CPU around right now. It\u2019s certainly the best gaming chip that AMD has ever made, but it\u2019s also capable of outperforming Intel\u2019s top CPU when it comes to gaming frame rates and is doing so for a lot less cash. It\u2019s also a lot less power-thirsty, too.\u201d Rave reviews such as this would have been considered unthinkable over a decade ago. After 50 years of playing second best to rival Intel (NASDAQ: INTC), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) surpassed it, thanks to CEO Dr. Linda Su, who took the reins in 2014 and AMD was able to unveil the Ryzen in 2017, which became a game changer. Based on a principle of multiple microscopic CPUs working in tandem, AMD\u2019s Ryzen CPU outperformed Intel\u2019s CPUs in speed and efficiency, and most importantly \u2013 cost only half as much. Ryzen and its later updates subsequently added tens of billions to AMD\u2019s revenues, and in 2022, AMD surpassed Intel in market cap, although not in chip market share. Headwinds and Challenges Under Dr. Lisa Su, AMD\u2019s Ryzen and Epyc CPUs have propelled the company to profitability and market cap superiority over longtime rival Intel. Despite AMD\u2019s phenomenal turnaround over the past decade, not everything has been smooth sailing and concern-free. Unlike Intel, AMD does not own manufacturing facilities in the US. Dr. Su\u2019s reputation and ties to Taiwan have created a strong relationship with manufacturing facilities owned by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co, (NYSE: TSM). While the relationship between AMD and TSMC remains robust, geopolitical tensions between Taiwan and China, whose CCP leadership continues to advocate for \u201creunification\u201d with Taiwan, even if by military invasion, continues to be a supply chain risk factor. While AMD\u2019s MI300 GPU is a viable competitor to Nvidia\u2019s H100, industry publication Tom\u2019s Hardware estimates that AMD\u2019s new chips sell for just 25% of the price of Nvidia\u2019s H100, despite their similar performance. This means less room for growth and lower margins. Additionally, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) isn\u2019t standing still. In Q1, the company announced its new Blackwell platform, designed to train generative AI models at a fraction of the cost of its predecessor. Nvidia\u2019s faster development cycle means that AMD may be stuck playing a game of catchup \u2014 putting further pressure on its pricing power, growth, and margins. US technology export restrictions require AMD, Nvidia, and other US chip makers to design lower-performance versions of their top products for export to China and the Middle East. Prior iterations from Q1 2024 were rejected by the Commerce Dept. as still being too powerful, and export licenses were withheld. The counterintuitive need to create a better device to market while simultaneously designing lower capabilities is proving to be a more delicate and difficult task than anticipated. Regardless, investors are much more concerned with future stock performance over the next 1, 5, to 10 years. While most Wall Street analysts will calculate 12-month forward projections, it\u2019s clear that nobody has a consistent crystal ball, and plenty of unforeseen circumstances can render even near-term projections irrelevant. 24/7 Wall Street aims to present some further-looking insights based on AMD\u2019s own numbers, along with business and market development information that may be of help to our readers\u2019 own research. Key Points In This Article Lisa Su\u2019s acquisitions of ZT Systems and various AI software companies are part of a comprehensive AI-focused strategy. The acquisition of ZT Systems, a cloud architecture solution provider, is a key building block of Lisa Su\u2019s AI development strategy objective, which is to provide AI in end-to-end computing. AMD\u2019s MI300 GPU and future models will continue to compete with Nvidia for the AI graphics market. AMD\u2019s chip architecture for Ryzen and other products will expand for installation applications beyond gaming, such as automobiles, IoT, and others. The threat of a PRC military invasion of Taiwan is still a major semiconductor supply chain threat, as AMD, Nvidia, Apple, and other tech companies all rely on Taiwan Semiconductor for its manufacturing needs.

Advanced Micro Devices News and Updates 12/20/2024 Morgan Stanley analysts have lowered their price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $169 to $158, while maintaining an \u201cequal weight\u201d rating on the stock. Despite this lowered target, it still suggest a potential upside of 30.75% from AMD\u2019s current price. 12/18/2024 Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 stock has reached a 52-week low of $121.82, valuing the company at $199 billion. This decline, coupled with a beta of 1.64, indicates significant price volatility as investors grapple with economic uncertainties and shifting market dynamics. 12/16/2024 Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 stock price dipped 1.3% in midday trading today, reaching a low of $123.12. Trading volume was also much lower than average, with only 15.7 million shares changing hands. 12/12/2024 Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 stock experienced a slight decline of 0.2% during today\u2019s midday trading, fluctuating between $129.13 and $129.92. Trading volume was also much lower than average. 12/11/2024 Advanced Micro Devices\u2019 CEO Lisa Su has been named Time Magazine\u2019s CEO of the year. Since taking over in 2014, Su has orchestrated an incredible turnaround for the company, driving AMD\u2019s stock price up by a staggering 3700%. 12/9/2024 Vivek Arya, an analyst with Bank of America, downgraded Advanced Micro Devices stock from \u201cBuy\u201d to \u201cNeutral\u201d and lowered its price target from $180 to $155. This downgrade follows Amazon\u2019s executives reports of weak demand for AMD\u2019s AI accelerators and led to a decline in AMD\u2019s stock today. 12/6/2024 AMD\u2019s stock price has gone down today. This decrease followed an Amazon executive\u2019s report that the company hasn\u2019t observed enough demand for AMD\u2019s AI accelerators to warrant their sale through Amazon Web Services. 12/5/2024 Mizuho has lowered its price target for Advanced Micro Devices from $185 to $180, but still maintains a \u201cBuy\u201d rating on the stock. This revised target price suggests a potential upside of 26.64% from AMD\u2019s current market price. 12/3/2024 Advanced Micro Devices stock declined 0.3% today, trading between $141.23 and $141.61. 11/27/2024 Advanced Micro Devices has solidified its commitment to Indian by inaugurating a new research and development center. This move aligns with the company\u2019s previously announced $400 million investment in the country. 5-10 Year Review A huge part of AMD\u2019s success has been the Damocles sword decision to have all foundry work performed by Taiwan Semiconductor. After stints at IBM and Texas Instruments, Dr. Lisa Su became COO of AMD, assuming the CEO position in 2014. Soon afterwards, she started her overhaul of the company by splitting it into 2 divisions: Computing and Graphics, which includes desktop and notebook processors and chipsets, discrete GPUs, and professional graphics; Enterprise, Embedded, and Semi-Custom, which includes server and embedded processors, dense servers, semi-custom SoC products (including solutions for gaming consoles), engineering services, and royalties. Dr. Su oversaw the release of the Radeon 300 and Fury series, the last of the Bulldozer derivatives, and then the RX 400 series of GPUs in 2016. Based on AMD\u2019s Zen architecture, both Epyc for servers and workstations Ryzen for laptops and desktops debuted in 2017. They innovatively took multiple micro CPUs to work as a team for superior computing power and speed. Ryzen, in particular, took the computing world and Intel by surprise, as it catapulted AMD to previously uncharted levels. 2020 saw AMD announce the acquisition of Xilinx for its field programmable gate arrays (FPGA). AMD would discontinue Xilinx production of its complex programmable logic devices (CPLD) in early 2024. Pensando Systems was added to AMD\u2019s portfolio in 2022, with Mipsology to follow in 2023. On the AI front, 2023 saw AMD acquire Nod.ai, followed by Silo.AI, Europe\u2019s largest private AI Lab, in 2024. Fiscal Year (Dec) Price Revenues Net Income 2015 $2.87 $3.991 B -($660 M) 2016 $11.34 $4.319 B -($498 M) 2017 $10.28 $5.253 B -($33 M) 2018 $18.46 $6.475 B $337 M 2019 $45.86 $6.731 B $341 M 2020 $91.71 $9.763 B $2.490 B 2021 $143.90 $16.434 B $3.162 B 2022 $64.77 $23.601 B $1.320 B 2023 $147.41 $22.680 B $864 M 2024 LTM (Jun 2024) $$162.21 $23.276 B $$1.354 B Key Drivers for AMD\u2019s Stock in the Future Lisa Su\u2019s release of AMD\u2019s MI300 GPU has thrown down the gauntlet for AI to her cousin, CEO Jensen Huang of Nvidia, which controls close to 70% of the AI GPU market at present. AMD\u2019s MI300 GPU (Graphics Processing Units) and similar products are addressing AI workloads for cloud computing, which is stirring up interest. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Oracle (NASDAQ: ORCL) are already using the MI300. As a result, AMD is now on the radar alongside other AI related stocks. The ZT Systems acquisition for $4.9 billion is a key building block of Lisa Su\u2019s AI development strategy. By integrating ZT\u2019s expertise in data center infrastructure, AMD will be able to offer complete AI solutions, encompassing hardware, software, and system-level integration. Therefore, AMD will soon provide a one-stop, comprehensive and integrated offering to clients seeking robust AI solutions. Data Center growth (already $2.3 billion sector revenues for AMD in Q1, +80% y-o-y), should continue to expand that area for the near and extended future. AMD 3D V-Cache chips will be an integral contributor to AMD-powered data center equipment. Stock Price Prediction for 2025 The consensus rating from over 40 Wall Street analysts is \u201cbuy/outperform\u201d (31 buy, 7 outperform, 10 hold). Their average price target in 12 months is $186.91, which is 47.99% from the price today. 24/7 Wall Street\u2019s 12-month projection for AMD\u2019s price is $205.20, which would be a 62.48% increase. We believe Dr. Su\u2019s goal of end-to-end AI utility is already underway, with AMD competing with Nvidia in a similar fashion and strategy to how it challenged Intel: with comparable or superior speed and performance for lower prices. AMD\u2019s Next 5 Years\u2019 Outlook The past 10-year median P/E ratio for AMD is 34.27. 24/7 Wall Street is using a more conservative P/E ratio of 30 for the following price predictions. These prices also preclude an invasion of Taiwan from China, which would understandably devastate chip manufacturing worldwide. For 2026, we predict a price of $237.12, which would be a 15.56% gain year-over-year. AMD\u2019s acquisition of ZT Systems will be a significant contributor to Dr. Su\u2019s AI development agenda. She anticipates that the AI accelerator and GPU chip market will reach $400 billion by 2027. AMD\u2019s Instinct and Epyc accelerators for machine learning will see a major boost in this surge. To follow up on the AI agenda, 2027 should benefit from ZT Systems\u2019 software boost capabilities. During 2023-24, AMD invested more than $1 billion to improve its AI software capabilities and R&amp;D activities. AMD has already made three small software AI-related acquisitions (Silo AI, Nod.ai, and Mipsology) to bolster its mid- and high-level software abstractions and help customers customize LLMs. Dr. Su and Nvidia\u2019s Jensen Huang are blood-relative cousins, and their respective competitive drives and tech savvy make the AMD and Nvidia rivalry in AI all the more compelling when the different components are compared head-to-head. The 24/7 Wall Street price target for 2027 is $294.40. This would be a 24.16% gain year-over-year. 2028 should see AMD get an upswing from its ancillary markets. For example, AMD\u2019s Ryzen is already a big part of the digital cockpits in the automotive market. Its partnerships with Daimler-Benz and Tesla will likely expand to other auto manufacturers as AI becomes more ubiquitous and demand escalates. Our price target is $306, a modest year-over-year gain of 3.94%. Edge computing would be another ancillary market for AMD that would benefit from AI. 2029 should see a boost in IoT applications using AMD-powered devices and digital architecture. AMD\u2019s Multi-Chip Modules (MCM) will continue to expand, with its Epyc Milan X, the first MCM GPU, leading the way for a range of other configurations. The resulting bump would be a target price of $336, a 9.80% gain from the previous year\u2019s price target. AMD Stock in 2030 AMD\u2019s development of end-to-end AI computing is Dr. Lisa Su\u2019s primary goal over the next decade. At present, no smartphone utilizes any AMD CPUs. Nevertheless, AMD has already announced the availability of Ryzen chips for mobile devices. By 2030, the growth of AI-powered mobile gaming should reach the point where the demand for Ryzen performance in smartphones by game-oriented users should see Ryzen-powered smartphones. This would be a huge boon for AMD, as the smartphone market is a major one that has long eluded it. The 24/7 Wall Street 2030 price target is $396.20. Year EPS P/E multiple Price 2025 $6.84 30 $205.20 2026 $7.90 30 $237.12 2027 $9.81 30 $294.40 2028 $10.20 30 $306.00 2029 $11.20 30 $336.00 2030 $13.21 30 $396.20 Get Ready To Retire (Sponsored) Start by taking a quick retirement quiz from SmartAsset that will match you with up to 3 financial advisors that serve your area and beyond in 5 minutes, or less.

        "text": "Live Updates Live Coverage Has Ended Markets Recover 4:05 pm by Gerelyn Terzo Talk about a roller coaster. After spiraling by over 600 points, the Dow Jones Industrial Average finished in the green, while the S&amp;P 500 similarly eked out a modest gain. The Nasdaq Composite finished slightly lower, but far from its worst levels of the day. While recession fears have been stoked now that the economy is officially slowing down, the markets shook it off, perhaps in anticipation of Meta (Nasdaq: META) and Microsoft&#8217;s (Nasdaq: MSFT) earnings this afternoon. Stocks Trim Losses 12:19 pm by Gerelyn Terzo President Trump has attributed the unexpected GDP contraction to the Biden Administration, surmising that economic growth will &#8220;take a while.&#8221; In the meantime, he urges Americans to stay patient as the next economic boom awaits. Stocks have trimmed their losses. NVDA a Sell 12:07 pm by Gerelyn Terzo One Wall Street firm has turned cautious on the AI boom. Seaport Research has reportedly downgraded shares of AI darling Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) to a &#8220;sell&#8221; rating, owing to worries about AI spending from businesses. Analyst Jay Goldberg believes that while Nvidia was a clear winner in the AI mania, the prospects are already built into the stock. Nvidia stock has shaved off 20% of its value year-to-date. The stock market has come off its lows of the day, with the Nasdaq Composite trimming its declines from approximately 3% to 1% while the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&amp;P 500 are down fractionally. Today&#8217;s sell-off was sparked by an economic contraction in Q1, thrusting the possibility of a recession further into the spotlight. Markets Off Worst Levels 10:53 am by Gerelyn Terzo In what is shaping up to be an historic market sell-off, stocks have come off their worst levels of the day. The Dow Jones Industrial Average has trimmed its losses from over 600 points to about 400 points, while the Nasdaq Composite and S&amp;P 500 are down by barely 2% each. In addition to the GDP shocker, the markets received more economic data to process from the labor market. Private payrolls rose by 62,000 in April, falling short of Dow Jones expectations for nearly double that growth. March saw a gain of 147,000 private payrolls, making the sting even worse. Companies are placing hiring on hold as they await the full impact of the Trump administration&#8217;s tariffs. Stock Market Drawdown 10:08 am by Gerelyn Terzo According to Goldman Sachs, if the economy were to slip into a recession, the stock market selling would intensify. Goldman Sachs Micro Strategist Vicky Chang warned that unlike past market cycles, this time around, headline risk signals the market bottom, not the economic trough, saying, &#8220;We still think there is significant vulnerability in a recession scenario, even if the worst of the underlying \u2018shock\u2019 has passed.&#8221; The economic slowdown is real. The U.S. economy contracted by 0.3% during Q1 2025 after corporate America rushed to receive imports before the tariffs kicked in. According to the Commerce Department, U.S. GDP declined at an annual rate of 0.3%, adjusted for inflation, the worst drop the economy has suffered in in three years. By way of comparison, economists were predicting an economic expansion of 0.4% in the first quarter, a far cry from the results as the tariff wars took hold. Stocks went into freefall mode in response, including a 600-point decline in the Dow Jones Industrial Average, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite spiraled by 2.7% and the S&amp;P 5oo lost 2.0%. Every single sector of the economy is trading lower as fears of an economic recession grip the markets. Each of the Magnificent Seven stocks are under pressure, including a steep 6% drop in Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) and declines of close to 4% for Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). What a day for Meta Platforms (Nasdaq: META) to be reporting quarterly earnings after the closing bell today. Here\u2019s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Down 646.83 (-1.6%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 454.57 (-2.6%) S&amp;P 500: Down 111.05 (-1.9%) Market Movers Starbucks (Nasdaq: SBUX) is losing 8% on the day and has been downgraded by Goldman Sachs to a &#8220;neutral&#8221; rating from &#8220;&#8216;buy&#8221; with a $85 price target attached, down from a previous target of over $100 per share. Starbucks reported Q1 results and missed Wall Street estimates on both the top and bottom lines. Social media platform Snap (NYSE: SNAP) is falling by over 15% this morning in the market sell-off after choosing to forego earnings guidance due to uncertainty from tariffs. First Solar (Nasdaq: FSLR) is losing 10% on the day after missing Q1 estimates and revealing the toll that tariffs will take on its revenue in 2025.

        "text": "Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) lost 2.29% over the past five trading sessions, halting a rally that has seen the stock gain 23.16% since its year-to-date low of $167.32 on April 21. On the year, the e-commerce giant has seen its stock lose 6.42% despite beating on EPS and revenue by 16.77% and 0.35%, respectively, in Q1. Tempered forward guidance due to President Trump&#8217;s tariffs continues to cloud Amazon&#8217;s outlook. However, with the U.S. and China agreeing to a 90-day reduction in tariffs on May 11, there is renewed hope for the consumer discretionary mainstay, who has seen its one-year gain diminished to 12.28%. In its recent earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% in 2025, with its one-year gain having been erased in Q1, which now stands at a 0.79% loss. In early April, Piper Sandler lowered its price target for Amazon to $215 from $265; however, the firm maintained its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating saying it is looking for Q1 revenue of $153B and within the $151B\u2013$155B guidance range. Piper forecasts AWS growth of 17% year-over-year. For Q2, the firm anticipates a guidance range of $157B\u2013$162B and op income guidance of $14B\u2013$18B. Piper lowered its 2025 ads revenue growth by about 1% and online stores and 3P services. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. Key Points in This Article: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you\u2019re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our \u201cThe Next NVIDIA\u201d report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has sunk 15.15%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; $240.62 consensus price target is just shy of Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 48 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 64.01% of shares held by institutional investors \u2014 including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street \u2014 the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,927 position increases versus 2,426 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -5.02% Median $240.62 17.19% High $305.00 48.55% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumers appear to be pulling back on spending due to ongoing inflation, contracting GDP in Q1 and the possibility of a recession in 2025. Over the past month, however, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 \u2014 into which Amazon falls \u2014 has performed admirably, posting a gain of 18.14%, second only to tech&#8217;s gain of 21.31% over the same period. That rebound represents a stark difference from the sector&#8217;s last-place performance among the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 11 sectors through Q1 2025. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

        "text": "Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) researchers recently released a paper named &#8216;Illusions of Thinking&#8216; that casts new doubts on the capabilities of &#8216;reasoning&#8217; models that are seeing tens of billions of dollars of research and development in the AI space. In the segment below, 24/7 Wall St. Analyst Eric Bleeker breaks down the implications of Apple&#8217;s newest paper. Bleeker says that investors will want to key in on whether AI can make &#8216;novel discoveries&#8217; in 2026. OpenAI CEO Sam Altman has predicted that leading AI models will begin making these discoveries in 2026. If that happens, AI spending will continue to race full speed ahead. If 2026 passes without novel discoveries, then Apple&#8217;s criticisms of reasoning models will look more compelling. Key Points Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is taking a contrarian stance in the AI space, downplaying reasoning model capabilities in a recent research paper and showing reduced AI emphasis at WWDC, contrasting sharply with peers&#8217; aggressive AI investments. While OpenAI, backed by Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), is pushing toward novel AI discoveries by 2026 with infrastructure like Stargate, Apple appears culturally and strategically hesitant to embrace foundational AI advancements. Despite skepticism from Apple\u2019s research, usage data and capabilities like DeepMind&#8217;s AlphaFold show current AI can already dramatically accelerate scientific discovery, offering substantial near-term economic value.

Instead its relying on partnerships with companies like OpenAI. At 24/7 Wall St., we believe the release of reasoning models &#8211; roughly corresponding to the release of o3 in December last year \u2026 Is the next step-change in AI model capabilities. However, a recent paper from Apple researchers casts doubt on the overall capabilities of reasoning models. The paper &#8211; named &#8216;Illusions of Thinking&#8217; &#8211; detailed how reasoning models solve a series of puzzles. The paper&#8217;s findings were essentially that reasoning models capabilities are more limited than believed &#8211; they&#8217;re just advanced pattern matching. Our take: we don\u2019t find the paper especially compelling. We won\u2019t get into too many details, but AI researchers we follow have poked some pretty sizable holes into how the study was conducted and its overall conclusions. Here&#8217;s what we think is important to watch if you&#8217;re concerend about Apple&#8217;s recent paper. One of the biggest criticisms of AI has been: Where are the novel discoveries? That is to say, while AI has contributed to some major discoveries like protein-folding, there have been no major discoveries directly made by leading AI models. Sam Altman, CEO of OpenAI, recently published a blog that\u2019s worth reading. It&#8217;s named &#8216;The Gentle Singularity.&#8217; In it, he lays out a timeline we can come back to and hold him accountable to. 2025: Rise of Agents 2026: Novel insights from AI 2027: Robots that can do tasks in the real world So, essentially he\u2019s dropping the gauntlet that GPT5 will be powerful enough for these novel discoveries\u2026 If that\u2019s the case, the upside for AI essentially becomes infinite; it is the driver for economic progress for the remainder of our lives. If it\u2019s wrong\u2026 Total spend on AI is likely too high at current rates.

The podcast covers the biggest developments in AI and how you can build a portfolio filled with the highest-upside stocks in the space. You can listen to our most recent episode on YouTube or leading podcast apps like Apple Podcasts or Spotify. Transcript: [00:00:05] Austin Smith: And now, you know, a, a counterpoint to that is I wanna talk about this Apple Illusions of thinking paper, because Apple is one of the largest tech companies that, you know what I mean? Like, like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Microsoft was really hot on AI. But in their most recent, uh, worldwide developer conference, there was way less AI, way less Apple intelligence than in the prior release. [00:00:24] Austin Smith: So on one hand, we&#8217;re seeing Apple sort of standalone here, and some of the, the steam is coming out of their own AI enthusiasm and they&#8217;re releasing this illusions of thinking paper that sort of puts a little bit of cold water on the AI narrative. So, but, but everything else we&#8217;re seeing is an increase in demand and compute and inference from everybody else in Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) and Microsoft and Google. [00:00:45] Austin Smith: So. What is going on with Apple? Are they, you know, is this a cultural change? Is this, is this something? Are they seeing something other people don&#8217;t? Why does Apple sort of stand alone here in this super major AI space? [00:00:58] Eric Bleeker: Yeah. Apple&#8217;s such an interesting company, right? Because everyone else is spending tens of billions of dollars on CapEx and they&#8217;ve kind of not played that game. [00:01:07] Eric Bleeker: They can do that in part because they have unique distribution right at the start of smartphones. You have said their greatest weakness is. Something like search all these Google services, they, they don&#8217;t control that and they&#8217;re beholding, but the end outcome was they end up charging Google 20 or $30 billion per year in pure profits to become the default search engine. [00:01:29] Eric Bleeker: So them being that initial point of distribution as the operating system for all consumer devices allows them to play a little bit of a different game. But it&#8217;s also kind of in their best interests. To kind of talk down some of the areas that they&#8217;re not competing in, which is a bit what this paper did. [00:01:50] Eric Bleeker: It comes from, um, apple researchers and basically we&#8217;ve talked about along this show, our belief is that in December of last year, the birth of new powerful reasoning models, which really began when oh three was released on December 20th, was the next step change in AI demand. And what Apple&#8217;s researchers came out and said is that they believe that these reasoning models that are coming out through a series of puzzles that they tried having them solve, that they put in the paper, basically had just a lot less capability than people believed. [00:02:28] Eric Bleeker: Essentially. They&#8217;re just much better at pattern matching, uh, than people give them credit for. So this Austin, this got a lot of attention, right? Because it&#8217;s potentially saying it&#8217;s, it&#8217;s another. A potential piece of evidence that we&#8217;re in a bubble, that AI is just going to hit a wall, where when you ask it to take that next step, the next step being discovering novel discoveries. [00:02:55] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. You know, asking AI to start doing things like finding cures for diseases. It&#8217;s not going to be able to make that jump. And if that is the case, that would be tremendously bad for that future of outlook and all the spending that&#8217;s happening right now. Right. So my take on this, and again, I am not an AI researcher. [00:03:16] Eric Bleeker: My main job is to basically find who I believe are the smartest minds and, and people that have great track records on this. I. And evaluate who I think is the most accurate. And, and I don&#8217;t find the paper especially compelling. I, I won&#8217;t get into too many details, but a lot of people have poked some pretty sizable holes into how this study was conducted. [00:03:39] Eric Bleeker: But I, I do wanna point out Austin, you know, of the other big storylines that&#8217;s, you know, maybe on the fringes that if, if you&#8217;re investing in ai you don&#8217;t see, was Sam Altman, who&#8217;s the CEO of Open AI. He released a blog this year, uh, or. This week, I should say, um, just about his thoughts on AI. It, it&#8217;s named the gentle Singularity. [00:04:01] Eric Bleeker: You could search that, you could search his blog and you could find it, but in layman&#8217;s terms, he&#8217;s, he&#8217;s making a lot of predictions you can hold him accountable to and in his belief. 2025. The story is the rise of agents. That&#8217;s something we agree with. We&#8217;ve been saying since last year, you know, mid last year, we&#8217;ve always said we believe the narrative this year, especially in the back half, would be the rise of agents. [00:04:27] Eric Bleeker: He believes 2026 is going to be the birth of novel insights from AI, and 2027 is robotics that can change the real world. So you know this, this lines up Austin, right? With a lot of storylines we&#8217;re talking about. But he is essentially dropping the gauntlet that, as I mentioned earlier, OpenAI is waiting for Stargate to become operational, uh, to basically train their next version, uh, GPT five, to have the capability to do that. [00:04:59] Eric Bleeker: And once that&#8217;s happened, he believes those novel discoveries will start becoming a storyline next year. So that becomes one of the things that we will be actively tracking on this podcast that. If you start seeing novel discoveries from AI, we are on pace. And frankly, if AI starts making meaningful novel discoveries, that is the strongest validation yet that it becomes the main economic driver for the rest of our lives. [00:05:30] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. And if that is the case and, and you&#8217;re not actively investing in this, good luck to you because that, that will be a little bit of a rubber meets the road moment. We&#8217;re gonna be watching out for. [00:05:42] Austin Smith: Right. And you know, to, to anybody who&#8217;s listening to that and saying, oh, well maybe I&#8217;ll wait until AI has proven in the, the novel discovery framework before I become an investor. [00:05:51] Austin Smith: I think that would be a mistake as well, because that&#8217;s not to say that the current versions of AI and LLMs don&#8217;t have incredible economic forces and tailwinds behind them. You talked about medicine discovery, uh, famously alpha fold, you know, detected protein foldings and predicted 3D structures of proteins, which is a very complicated, uh, thing to do. [00:06:10] Austin Smith: And it didn&#8217;t necessarily uncover new breakthroughs per se, but it completely supercharged the discovery of these, uh, folding structures that would&#8217;ve been discovered just over a much longer timeframe. So it pulled forward all of those discoveries faster. Now, that might not necessarily have been novel. [00:06:26] Austin Smith: It was applying techniques that, as I understand it, certainly not an AI researcher, but was applying techniques that. We already had and knew, but just completely supercharged them and allowed us to make discoveries earlier. You know, when I read the, the, or tried to read, I should say, the illusions of Thinking paper by Apple, it, it sounded a little bit to me like a case. [00:06:45] Austin Smith: Maybe it&#8217;s just a case of someone coming from sour grapes a little bit like I. You know, Apple&#8217;s always been a bit of a taste maker company and designing the thing you, you didn&#8217;t know you needed and then you can&#8217;t live without. And they&#8217;ve been uniquely good at that, perhaps the best of all time. Um, but technologically speaking, a reasoning model just gives up a lot of that to, to the model. [00:07:02] Austin Smith: And it might be just culturally antithetical to, to what Apple is built on as a company. So, you know, I&#8217;m, I you gotta pay attention to everything that happens in this space. Apple&#8217;s incredibly gifted at what they do. Um, but this, this didn&#8217;t change my thinking about the potential of, of what we&#8217;re seeing. [00:07:17] Eric Bleeker: And I do wanna double click on one point you made there that you know, you can always say, I will just wait for this. Next, threat or overhang to resolve before I invest. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s so important to go through the cycles that as new trends happen that you&#8217;re able to see in real time. [00:07:35] Eric Bleeker: There is always something new that says, there&#8217;s a reason I shouldn&#8217;t invest in this today. So if you&#8217;re waiting for one threat to go. There will be another. Nothing is an absolute slam dunk. Last week, Austin, we talked about the best time on a risk adjusted basis to buy Apple was six years after mobile started. [00:07:52] Eric Bleeker: Mm-hmm. Um, the trough of disillusionment for the internet itself came eight years after it started. There&#8217;s always going to be some new threat that, you know, unless you followed one of these cycles, to truly appreciate that you&#8217;re never going to make money investing in a perfectly rosy picture. It&#8217;s just really hard to understand that that&#8217;s part of why we wanted to start this podcast was to give that record of investing throughout the a i Age. [00:08:22] Eric Bleeker: &#8217;cause at some point in retrospect, it&#8217;ll be, I believe it&#8217;ll be of course. Why didn&#8217;t you invest in that AI was obvious, right? And it&#8217;s not obvious. And we&#8217;ve broken down all the areas where we had to be incredibly. Counter to the dominant narratives, you know, you&#8217;ll be able to go back around When we did our deep seek episodes, where we called it before it happened, where we broke it down after, and we have been knocking down a lot of these, you know, bear cases. [00:08:53] Eric Bleeker: It&#8217;s, it&#8217;s not because we are blind cheerleaders for AI. Far from it, you know, we are people who want to make money and the only thing that makes you money in the long run is what happens in reality. But you know, again, we, we have believed that this story&#8217;s happening and, and we have gone through many of these threats in the front half of the year to have a show today that is. [00:09:19] Eric Bleeker: Largely just focused on acceleration and bullishness, which couldn&#8217;t be any different from what we were seeing five, six months ago.\u200b The post OpenAI CEO Sam Altman Predicts AI&#8217;s &#8216;Make or Break&#8217; Moment is Almost Here appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

        "text": "AI stocks have been on a ferocious rally in June. NVIDIA (Nasdaq: NVDA) is up 13% in the past month and currently sits at an all-time high, trading for $157.75 per share. In the segment below, 24/7 Wall St. Analyst Eric Bleeker discusses the big news that&#8217;s been driving AI stocks north. Recent news from Oracle (Nasdaq: ORCL) and OpenAI partnering with Google are all bullish and point toward continuing rabid demand in the AI space. Key Points OpenAI&#8217;s growing compute needs have led it to form new partnerships beyond Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), including with Google (NASDAQ: GOOGL), signaling unexpectedly strong infrastructure demand. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) reported a surge in AI-related revenues, with infrastructure growth forecasted to accelerate from 50% to 70% and backlog (RPO) expected to double, reinforcing signs of industry-wide AI momentum. Despite earlier fears of a pullback in AI spending post-Deep Seek, high model usage retention and ongoing training needs suggest accelerating demand into 2026, contrary to prior Wall Street expectations.

Bears pointed to this being evidence that investment in AI was unsustainable and would soon crater. We repeatedly poured cold water on this story on the AI Investor Podcast. First: Microsoft had publicly broken up with OpenAI &#8211; its main AI customer. Demand they had previously booked was simply moving to Oracle &#8211; the company behind OpenAI\u2019s \u2018Stargate\u2019 Project. Second: Despite all the talk of pulling back on spending, Microsoft itself was still projecting growth in its capital spending next year. Fast forward to today: Oracle reported earnings recently and saw its stock soar. The headline: The company projects that growth rates in cloud infrastructure will grow from 50% this year to 70% next year. And the company&#8217;s RPO (think of this as backlog) is increasing at over a 100% rate. And beyond Oracle, news has recently broken that OpenAI will also be partnering with Google for additional demand. When it comes to AI, there are two primary costs for a company like OpenAI: Training models \u2018Inference\u2019 &#8211; or running them Training: After DeepSeek, many believed that training costs would plummet. Yet, the opposite is actually happening. For example, OpenAI can&#8217;t move forward with its next-generation GPT5 model until it gets more compute capacity. And Inference demand has been absolutely exploding this year. OpenAI itself is now at a run rate of more than $10 billion in annual revenue and continues to grow fast. The company is seeing some of the highest retention among any consumer applications. The reason for that incredible retention: people are using the product! The big question for 2026 that will determine how most AI stocks perform\u2026 If OpenAI is racing to find more computing capacity and might be stalled until Stargate comes online That means all the other companies building frontier models are likely facing similar constraints. If that&#8217;s the case, 2026 will see unexpectedly high growth. Stocks across the AI space are are north as projections for AI spending in 2026 and beyond continue to increase. Don&#8217;t Miss an Episode of the AI Investor Podcast This segment was from our AI Investor Podcast, where we discuss the biggest news in artificial intelligence and what it means for the stocks in your portfolio. You can watch recent episodes on our YouTube channel or on any major podcast service. Transcript: [00:00:05] Austin Smith: Open AI has an insatiable appetite for compute. Uh, they famously paired up with Microsoft in their early days. Now they&#8217;re pairing up with anyone and everyone who will give them compute, including Google (NASDAQ: GOOG). What is going on and what does this say about AI demand? [00:00:20] Eric Bleeker: Yeah. One of the key storylines we covered at the beginning of the year was there is a major sell off in AI stocks because of DeepSeek. There&#8217;s geopolitical reasons, and a third major reason was reports about Microsoft basically scaling back their ambitions. [00:00:34] Eric Bleeker: Now, we had said that we weren&#8217;t as concerned with this because number one, Microsoft very publicly had broken up with Open AI. So if you&#8217;re looking at Microsoft decreasing spending. Well, if they had a breakup with their biggest partner, and you need to watch for where demand was headed with, you know, its new partnerships. [00:00:52] Eric Bleeker: And in spite of all that, despite Microsoft losing its biggest and best customer, they were still projecting growth next year on their capital expenditures. So let&#8217;s fast forward today. Oracle reported last night, Wednesday night. The stocks up 8%. The headline is they&#8217;re predicting a massive acceleration. [00:01:13] Eric Bleeker: AI revenues next year, their growth rate for uh, infrastructure is supposed to go from 50 to 70%. And their RPO, which you could think of it like a backlog that&#8217;s projected to grow another a hundred percent. And then you have the news that Google. Is going to work with open AI, you know, giving them one more, uh, source for this compute demand. [00:01:37] Eric Bleeker: So, you know, Austin, I think the big picture is there are two main costs when we&#8217;re looking at all these companies in the data center chain, whether it&#8217;s Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) or up to all these optic plays that we&#8217;ve talked about. One cost is training, the other cost is actually running the models themselves. So the training costs. [00:02:00] Eric Bleeker: The fact is a lot of the belief post deep seek was that training simply too expensive. And we&#8217;re going to see companies pull back on this. We&#8217;re seeing the opposite right now, which is open ai. They cannot move forward with their next major generation, GPT5 until Stargate is online. And then they have a second wave, which is inference Austin, right now, open ai. [00:02:28] Eric Bleeker: They are seeing 90% retention after one month, 80% retention after six months. It&#8217;s not just the fastest grown consumer product ever. It&#8217;s also the most sticky. You know, that&#8217;s the best in breed companies in terms of retention would kill for 90% after a month would kill for 80%. So there&#8217;s huge usage. And then there&#8217;s the side that this additional training is also needed. [00:02:55] Eric Bleeker: So, you know, I would say Austin. The big bullet point here is just we&#8217;re beginning to see a storyline of acceleration into 2026, far beyond what Wall Street&#8217;s been estimating months ago, let alone today. Because if Open AI&#8217;s waiting for more capacity to do this pre-training, people thought was going to moderate. [00:03:16] Eric Bleeker: All the other big companies are going to have to follow that same game plan. And number two, the consumer usage of AI is exploding, which is causing storylines like open AI, going to Google. So we&#8217;ll cover this more and more, but this is, this is the main theme of today&#8217;s show that. When we started the show back in 2024, we said, well, we&#8217;re not gonna see the slowdown people expect in 2025, but that&#8217;s gotten pushed into 2026, and that&#8217;s what you worry about. [00:03:48] Eric Bleeker: And now we&#8217;re starting to see 2026, not just be a period of moderation or fears of worst case scenario. There&#8217;s a lot of talk of acceleration, which might be crazy to people watching because. You know what? Everything is wrapped in fear. We had this deep seek moment. What if AI stops and all of a sudden that narrative, it&#8217;s really changing when you see what people are saying. [00:04:13] Eric Bleeker: You see the actions of these companies.\u200b The post The #1 Reason AI Stocks Are Soaring Again in June appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",

        "text": "West Wits Mining Ltd (ASX:WWI, OTCQB:WMWWF) will bank ZAR 875 million (approximately US$50M, AU$76.5M) after signing definitive agreements for a senior syndicated loan facility to fund the Qala Shallows Gold Project in South Africa. This is a significant step in the development of the first phase of the Witwatersrand Basin Project and coincides with the delivery of a 7.5-tonne underground Load-Haul-Dump (LHD) unit to the Qala Shallows site, marking the start of on-the-ground mine development works. The development is expected to generate over 1,000 direct jobs and serve as a catalyst for regional development over the mine\u2019s 18-year life. \u201cThe signing of the legal agreements marks a transformative moment for West Wits. Securing this facility is the result of years of focused effort and a strong endorsement of the Qala Shallows Project by top tier South African financial institutions,\u201d West Wits CEO Rudi Deysel said. \u201cSeeing our first LHD unit arrive on site is incredibly exciting. It is a tangible symbol of progress and the beginning of a new chapter as we bring the project to life.\u201d West Wits has executed agreements for a senior syndicated loan facility with the Industrial Development Corporation of South Africa and Absa Bank Ltd, through its Corporate and Investment Banking Division. The facility, which will fund approximately 55% of the Qala Shallows development costs, has a 24-month drawdown period and a 36-month repayment term. Interest is linked to the Johannesburg Interbank Average Rate (JIBAR), and 100% of mandatory hedging will be covered by put options, allowing upside exposure to gold prices. The loan will fund development, construction, commissioning and initial operations at Qala Shallows. The remaining 45% of funding will be sourced from equity and early operational revenue. Zwano Nxumalo, project financier at Absa Corporate and Investment Banking, said: \u201cWe\u2019re proud to support West Wits on the Qala Shallows Gold Project \u2014 a development that will drive local job creation, economic growth, and sustainable mining in the Witwatersrand Basin. This facility reflects our continued commitment to enabling impactful, long-term investments in South Africa\u2019s resources sector.\u201d Following an A$14 million equity raise, West Wits is pressing ahead with mine development activities at Qala, after an increase in ownership of the broader Witwatersrand Basin Project (WBP) to 74%. LHD Unit loaded for delivery to Qala Shallows marking the start of mobilisation as West Wits moves into active development. Key work streams include the buy-back of minority interests in its South African subsidiary, an optimised Definitive Feasibility Study (DFS) reflecting stronger gold prices and improved economics, mobilisation for ore extraction at Qala Shallows, and progress on its long-term Project 200 expansion strategy. \u201cIt is with great excitement that we kick-off the Qala Shallows Project. The West Wits team undertook extensive preparatory work to ensure that the project will be delivered as a safe, productive and within-budget operation. Service supplier agreements have now been executed with initial orders placed and the first piece of equipment to be delivered this week,\u201d Deysel said. \u201cAs West Wits Mining advances to becoming a gold producer, we will continue to focus on ways to realise the potential of the stunning Witwatersrand Basin Project to further grow the business we are starting.\u201d Facility proceeds are strictly applied to Qala Shallows project development. US President Donald Trump has announced the immediate termination of all trade talks with Canada, ending months-long negotiations between the two countries following Canada\u2019s announcement of a new digital services tax (DST). The DST targets large foreign and domestic digital companies, including major US tech firms such as Meta, Apple, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. Set to take effect retroactively from 2022, starting on Monday, the DST imposes a 3% tax on large digital companies' revenues from online advertising, social media, online marketplaces, and user data licensing in Canada. Trump posted on his social media platform Truth Social that due to this digital services tax, the US will end all trade discussions with Canada effective immediately and plans to inform Canada within the next week about the tariff rates Canada will be required to pay for conducting business with the US. He accused Canada of copying the European Union, which has implemented a similar tax, and described it as \u201ca direct and blatant attack on our country.\u201d \u201cBased on this egregious Tax, we are hereby terminating ALL discussions on Trade with Canada, effective immediately,\u201d Trump wrote in a post on Truth Social. \u201cWe will let Canada know the Tariff that they will be paying to do business with the United States of America within the next seven day period.\u201d Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s office did not immediately comment on Trump\u2019s remarks.",
